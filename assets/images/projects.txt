Project name (working): NATIONAL SYNTHETIC MEDIA ATTRIBUTION & EARLY WARNING SYSTEM (SAM-TRACE)
Why this project?

Synthetic media (deepfakes, AI-generated audio/video, hyper-targeted AI phishing) is now being used by both criminal syndicates and hostile states to: defraud citizens, disrupt public trust, manipulate elections/public policy, and enable espionage/social engineering. Existing detection tools are reactive, brittle to new model releases, and crucially — attribution and provenance (who created/seeded a fake, where it first spread) at national scale is unsolved. INTERPOL, Microsoft and other orgs call synthetic media a major emerging risk.

What SAM-TRACE does (high level)

Nationwide multimodal ingestion & monitoring — continuous crawling/ingestion of social media, OTT platforms, messaging metadata (where available via partner APIs), TV broadcast feeds, and dark-web indexes to gather candidate media.

Multimodal detection engine — ensemble of detectors for image/video/audio/text (forensic signal analysis, model-fingerprint detectors, and behaviour/metadata anomaly detectors). Use both supervised detectors and specialized adversarial-robust detectors.

Provenance & attribution layer — fuse forensic traces (model fingerprints, encoding traces, metadata timelines) with network-propagation analysis to produce probabilistic “origin chains” (who/which account first posted it, likely generation model family, and likely geographic origin). Maintain chain-of-custody evidence suitable for investigators.

Network propagation & influence analysis — graph analytics to see how content spreads, cluster accounts (bots / coordinated campaigns), measure reach and risk to critical groups (e.g., mass influencers, government pages, election pages).

Early-warning & takedown coordination — risk scoring, alert dashboards to government SOCs, and standardized evidence packages for legal/takedown requests to platforms.

Public-facing verification service & registry — a government-maintained “verified content” registry with cryptographically signed official media (for comparison and public verification).

Federated research & continuous learning — privacy preserving federated learning with platforms and CERTs to keep models current without centralizing private data.

Why this is novel & hard (and therefore a true NTRO play)

Detection is not the same as provenance/attribution. Many teams build detectors; few systems provide courtroom-quality provenance (source timeline + probabilistic attribution) at nation scale. The arms race between new generative models and detectors is ongoing — detection alone isn’t enough for national security response. Microsoft/INTERPOL flag synthetic media as a national problem.

Scale & Multi-jurisdictional data: Need to ingest petabytes across platforms and combine network propagation with signal forensics — both computationally and legally complex.

Adversarial robustness: Attackers will obfuscate model fingerprints and abuse content manipulation pipelines; research in adversarial-robust detectors and model provenance is immature.

Forensics + Legal standards: Producing admissible evidence chains for court/action requires rigor and standardisation that isn’t widely implemented for synthetic media.

Technical components (sketch)

Ingestion layer: social APIs, broadcast capture, honeypots, TOR/darknet scanners, telemetry feeds from ISPs/CERT partnerships (metadata only if legally permitted).

Storage: immutable object store with chunked hashing + time attestation (e.g., timestamping with a national timestamping authority) to preserve chain-of-custody.

Detection ensemble: model-fingerprint classifiers (frequency-domain, compression artefacts), CNN/transformer detectors, audio forensic tools (speaker embedding anomalies), text-style LLM detectors, and metadata consistency checks.

Provenance engine: graph DB (content nodes, account nodes, host nodes), probabilistic inference engine that fuses forensic likelihoods with propagation timelines.

Explainability & evidence builder: generate human-readable forensic reports + cryptographically signed evidence bundles for legal use.

Dashboard & APIs: SOC dashboards (alerts, maps), platform takedown packages, anonymous public verification API.

Key research milestones / evaluation metrics

Detection accuracy vs. SOTA on benchmark deepfake datasets (precision/recall under adversarial variants)

Attribution confidence: percent of cases where the system correctly identifies first poster / model family in controlled tests

Time-to-alert: median time from first post to system alert (goal: hours)

False positive tolerance: legal / societal harm minimized — conservative thresholds for public alerts, human analyst confirmation loop.

Resilience to adversarial obfuscation: evaluate using intentionally perturbed fakes.

Stakeholders & partnerships

National CERT, Ministry of IT/Communication, Media regulators, major social platforms (APIs/cooperation), telecoms, broadcasters, intelligence agencies, law enforcement, legal advisors, universities (research). INTERPOL/Interpol Innovation Centre and Microsoft reports recommend multi-stakeholder models.

Ethics & privacy

Strictly limit collection to public content and metadata unless lawful process obtained. Federated learning + homomorphic/preserving techniques where feasible. Include an ethics & oversight board; publish transparency reports.

Challenges & risks

Platform cooperation may be inconsistent. Legal issues around surveillance and free speech. Arms race — attackers will evolve. Need to avoid chilling legitimate speech.

Project Idea: NATIONAL DIGITAL SUPPLY-CHAIN INTEGRITY & MODEL TRUST PLATFORM (DSIMT)
Why this matters

Many sectors (government, defence, healthcare, fintech, IoT, smart cities) rely on software/firmware and AI/ML models that they did not themselves build — they come via vendors, open-source ecosystems, third-party libraries, or AI model marketplaces. Attackers increasingly exploit:

software supply-chain attacks (insertion of malware into vendor updates) — now a major threat. 
Secureframe

HDFC ERGO Insurance

vulnerability of ML/AI models themselves (poisoning, back-doors, stolen models) and misuse of models deployed in critical systems.

lack of national-scale frameworks to certify and continuously monitor integrity of vendor software/firmware and deployed models.

Impact on society: A compromised supply chain or attacked AI model in a hospital, smart grid, telecom network or government system can result in large-scale outages, data theft, physical safety hazards, and loss of trust.

What DSIMT does

This platform would aim to provide a national-scale end-to-end monitoring, certification and real-time integrity-assurance service for software/firmware and ML/AI models used in critical systems across sectors.

Key components

Vendor attestation & trust registry — A secure national registry of vetted vendors/vendors’ components (software, firmware, ML models), with version tracking, hashes, provenance metadata, and continuous monitoring.

Model & firmware provenance tracking — For ML/AI models: track model lineage (data sources, training data provenance, architecture, modifications/patches). For firmware/software: track vendor chain, update history, build signatures, and dependencies (SBOM: software bill of materials).

Real-time monitoring & anomaly detection — Instrument deployed components in critical systems to send integrity telemetry / behaviour metrics (e.g., unusual model inference patterns, slow drift, firmware patches from unexpected vendor, dependency changes). Build anomaly detectors (ML-based) to flag possible poison/backdoor or supply-chain insertion.

Incident playbooks & remediation orchestration — When an anomaly or vendor provenance risk is detected: provide automated workflows (isolate component, switch to fallback, notify national SOC/critical-infrastructure ops).

Certification & Continuous Audit Framework — Regular audits of vendor code/model updates, automatic re-certification, public dashboards of component risk levels, vendor compliance score-cards.

Cross-sector data sharing & alerting — Shared data feeds between sectors (telecom, power, healthcare, government) to enable early warning if a vendor component shows suspicious activity elsewhere.

Why this is novel & challenging

While there are SBOM initiatives and vendor risk frameworks, very few national-scale platforms integrate software/firmware provenance + ML/AI model integrity + real-time telemetry + cross-sector alerting.

ML/AI model integrity is an emerging field: poisoning/backdoor detection is still immature.

Supply-chain attacks continue to escalate, with adversaries living off slow detection and long dwell times. Existing frameworks are reactive rather than proactive.

Multi-sector coordination (healthcare + power + government + tele-com + IoT) adds complexity: different vendor ecosystems, regulatory regimes, risk models.

Building instrumentation in deployed critical systems (often legacy) is operationally and technically hard.

Technical architecture sketch

Registry & metadata DB: component entries (vendor, type, version, SBOM, model lineage, known dependencies).

Telemetry ingestion & analytics layer: deployed agents (or network taps) send telemetry to analytics backend (behaviour logs, inference patterns, firmware update events, dependency changes).

Anomaly detection engine: combining behaviour baselines + vendor provenance anomalies + model drift/backdoor detection signals.

Dashboard/alerting: national SOC view, vendor scorecards, incident workflow.

Certification engine: automated build signature verification, SBOM verification, model-lineage verification, vendor patch frequency and risk scoring.

Inter-sector feed & sharing: secure cross-sector message bus/disclosure portal for sharing vendor/component risk events.

Key research/metric focus

Time to detection of supply-chain insertion/backdoor vs current average dwell-time.

False positive / false negative rate of model-poisoning/backdoor detection under adversarial conditions.

Coverage: % of critical infrastructure components registered and monitored (target >70% in Year 1).

Vendor compliance improvement: reduction in vendor component risk score over time.

Cross-sector shared incident reduction: number of vendor-component compromise events prevented or mitigated through the platform.

Stakeholders & deployment

Government CERT / Ministry of IT-Telecom / Critical Infrastructure Authority.

Sector agencies: energy, water, transport, healthcare, telecom.

Vendors / OEMs / model providers: on-boarding trust framework.

National SOC + forensic/legal units.

Academic partners: for model-poisoning/backdoor research.

Ethics & privacy

Telemetry collection must respect privacy, especially in healthcare/infrastructure. Use anonymization and data minimization.

Vendor transparency, avoid vendor lock-in.

Ensure fair vendor certification process, avoid monopoly bias.

Risks & mitigation

Legacy systems may resist instrumentation ? design lightweight agents or network-level monitoring.

Vendor non-cooperation ? policy/regulatory incentives or mandates.

Adversaries evolving faster ? ensure continuous research pipeline and update capability.

Why this is a strong NTRO-project

Protects society and national security by securing the backbone of digital systems (software, firmware, AI) that almost every sector relies on.

Fills a gap: many efforts target detection of attacks, but national-scale continuous integrity & provenance + model trust across sectors is very nascent.

Interdisciplinary: supplies cyber-forensics, ML/AI security, software supply-chain, national policy/regulation.

Measurable and can scale: you can pilot with selected sectors/vendors and expand.
